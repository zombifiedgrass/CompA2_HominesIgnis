/*
File for personal skyrim mod project (shouldn't be public so use temperamentally).
The project is an attempt to create a skyrim mod using c++, as a student it is mine to use and edit alone however if anyone
can give some input, it would be greatly apreciated.
It will likely be inclomplete as this reposetory is being used as a SVN link between computers.
